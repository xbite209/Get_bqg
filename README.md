## Installation


You need to create the "my章节" directory.

          "my章节"directory  
          
Because the third-party package file "github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery" is imported, you need to make the following settings.

          go mod init Directory Name or Path  
          
          go get github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery
